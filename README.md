# SlugLab
Repository for exploration of random matrices, spring 2025 topics course UCSC Mathematics.
This is a repository for our research course at UCSC.  There will be cryptic, hard-to-read notes, matlab code, and mathematica files.
The matlab files are very simple, and generate random matrices, then histograms of the eigenvalues. 
These notes are intended for the use of the participants in our course, and come with no gaurantees as to correctness.
